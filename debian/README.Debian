User must be in the dialout group in order to write to USB/Serial ports.

Fedora uses zenity to ask if a user wants to be added, but it is a big download.

I wrote our own java code, in debian/permission-checker, which will ask if the
user would like to be added, then runs a script with pkexec to add the user
to the dialout group.
