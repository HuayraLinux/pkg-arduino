arduino-core for Debian
-----------------------

N.B.  This package has been tested only on my laptop, with my
      Arduino Duemilanove -- your miliage may vary

This package contains the bare minimum required to program an Arduino
using Arduino sketches via the command line.

It DOES NOT contain the Java IDE -- if that's want you want, feel free
to addopt this package, and base it off the upstream tarball, but if
you do so please ensure that there's still an arduino-core package for
the java averse amongst us.

I'd suggest having packages:

  arduino-java  (the full IDE)
  arduino-gtk   (from here: http://sites.google.com/site/arduinogtkide/)
  arduino-core  (this)

QuickStart

  create a new directory, and change to it (its name doesn't matter):

    mkdir ~/arduino-playpen ; cd ~/arduino-playpen

  grab a copy of the Makefile:

    cp /usr/src/arduino/Makefile .

  grab an example:

    cp /usr/share/doc/arduino-core/examples/Digital/Blink/Blink.pde .

  compile and upload it:

    make TARGET=Blink

    make TARGET=Blink upload

  or do it all at once, thus:

    make TARGET=Blink all upload

  If the upload doesn't work, try unplugging/replugging the Arduino.

BTW Compared with the upstream, that Makefile has been tweaked to put
the products of compilation in a local build/ dir, so that you can use
the files under /usr/src while not being root.

=-=-=-=-

Please tell me if it fails for you, and if possible, what you did to
the Makefile to make it work.

I did consider making a script that would automate the above QuickStart,
but I think you're going to want to do it by hand at some point, so you
might as well do that from the start.  I'm open to persuasion that some
sort of script is needed if only to tell people who tryto run it to read
this file instead ;-)
