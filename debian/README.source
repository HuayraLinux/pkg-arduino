This package gets its source from a combination of the upstream SVN and
upstream released tarball, please inspect the rules file's get-orig-source
target. Both are found at http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software. This package
follows what would happen in the make.sh and dist.sh scripts in a Debian
compliant way.

Patches are described in debian/patches directly.
