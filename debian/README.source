arduino-core for Debian
-----------------------

Rather than use the upstream tarball, which has loads of irrelevant
stuff in it (from Debian's point of view) I just grabbed the bits I
needed out of the depths of their svn, thus:

  svn co http://arduino.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/hardware/cores/arduino

as well as grabbing the license.txt from the top level:

  svn co http://arduino.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

Other than that, this is a standard source package
